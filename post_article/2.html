					This is a summary of our <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104458032100108X?via%3Dihub">paper</a>
					published in 2021 in the scientific journal <i>Materials Characterization</i>. We
					proposed a new method for fast and autonomous characterization of the grain
					microstructure in metals. Our method was based on similarity learning, a
					concept also used in digital and facial recognition systems.
				</p>

				Have you ever wondered what you
				would see by looking at a piece of metal closely under a microscope? In many
				cases, the surface is made of a vast aggregate of microscopic grains, which are
				in fact small crystals oriented in different directions. The size, shape, and
				orientation of these grains influence properties of the material, such as
				strength and toughness, and are indicative of the conditions of temperature and
				pressure in which the material was formed. Analysing the grain microstructure
				can help understand and control many industrial processes. In laboratories, grain
				characterization is usually carried based on optical micrographs of a
				cross-section of the material. The challenge is to accurately segment the image
				into its constituent grains, which is done using digital image processing
				algorithms.
			</p>

			<p>
				During my time as a Research
				Associate in the <i>Additive Microstructure Engineering Laboratory</i> at NTU
				in Singapore, my team was interested in developing a
				more effective grain segmentation technique compared to pre-existing techniques.
				We suggested that capturing not just one, but many images of the grains while
				varying the position of the light source around the sample would enable to
				collect more information about the grains and facilitate their differentiation.
				To prove that concept, we built a specialized microscope that let us realize this
				analysis. Acquiring the data was fine; the main difficulty stemmed from that, for
				each studied microstructure, our microscope was producing around 1’800
				high-resolution images of the grains, each taken under a different illumination
				condition. This is like capturing a “super&#8209;image” of the microstructure
				containing not just three (as in RGB-coloured images) but 1’800 independent
				channels. Most existing segmentation algorithms were not designed to handle that
				many channels. Therefore, we designed our own approach to extract the grain structure
				from the datasets.
			</p>

			<p>
				A relevant first step was to <i>
					reduce
					dimensionality
				</i> of the data (the number of channels) to some lower number, while
				preserving as much information about the grains as possible. To achieve this, we
				used a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization" target="_blank">
					Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
				</a>(NMF).
				Using NMF, we were able to “distillate” the dataset
				by compressing it into only twenty channels, which were all highly concentrated
				with information about the grains. Next was the <i>real</i> challenge: figuring
				out how to extract the grains from the dataset. Here, the problem consists of
				grouping together all the pixels that belonged to a single grain. Each pixel is
				associated with twenty numbers representing its “coordinates” in the NMF space.
				Presumably, in this high-dimensional space pixels belonging to the same grain
				are close together, while pixels belonging to different grains are far from
				each other.
			</p>

			<p>
				If the NMF space had only three
				dimensions instead of twenty, we would be able to visualize all the pixels in
				it. We can achieve this by further compressing the dataset, this time using the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding" target="_blank">
					t-SNE
				</a>algorithm. In the image below, we
				selected a small portion of the field of view containing about 100 grains (in a
				real application, there would be many more grains) and projected the pixels
				using T-SNE. We coloured the data points based on the <i>ground truth</i>
				segmentation to emphasize that <b>
					pixels from the same grain tend to aggregate together
				</b>. In this example case, we could easily segment
				the grains using clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, …), however a
				clustering approach would not scale well to large number of grains in the
				thousands, or more.

			<p>
				This is where we had the idea of
				approaching the problem by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_learning" target="_blank">
					similarity learning
				</a>.
				The idea is based on the observation that, fundamentally, we want to be able to
				pick any two pixels from the dataset and answer the questions: <i>
					Do these two
					pixels belong to the same or to different grains
				</i>? If we are able to
				determine that, we will have solved the grain segmentation problem. Interestingly,
				the same kind of question underlines, for example, facial recognition and
				fingerprint reader systems: “<i>
					Does this fingerprint belong to the authorized
					user (it is the same person) or not (it is a different person)?
				</i>”.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because there are two possible
				outcomes, we need a <i>binary classifier</i> model. We can train it to
				determine if two input pixels are from the same (S) or from different (D)
				grains. From there, there are two variants to similarity learning. The first possible
				approach aims at figuring out the classification boundary between the <i>similar</i>
				and <i>dissimilar</i> domains. This is the approach we used in the paper.
				Because the multi-angle reflectance data was rich and the NMF decomposition
				powerful, we found that a simple logistic regression classifier was enough to
				do the job of separating the S and D domains. Compared to a more complex model,
				such as an artificial neural network, logistic regression was fast and less
				prone to overfitting, which was perfect for our application. The other possible
				approach would be to finding a <i>transform</i> that brings similar examples
				closer together and dissimilar examples further from each other, so that the
				two ensembles can be easily separated. This could be achieved, for example, by
				training a Siamese neural network on the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplet_loss" target="_blank">triplet loss</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				To segment the microstructures,
				we combined the binary classifier with a region-merging algorithm. Every pixel
				starts as a different “region” and neighboring regions are progressively merged
				based on the output of the binary classifier. This leads to a segmentation
				because, at every step, the classifier is answering the question: <i>
					are these two pixels from the same or from different grains?
				</i> In one case, the pixels
				are merged and in the other, they are left separate. The process automatically
				leads to a grain segmentation.

			</p>

			<p>
				To conclude, this work was made
				possible by (i) the clever idea of capturing many images of the grains under
				different illuminations, (ii) an effective way of pre-processing the
				multi-illumination data by dimensionality reduction, (iii) realizing that the
				problem could be addressed by similarity learning, and (iv) the integration of
				a binary classifier to a region-merging algorithm. The result is a new
				technique to perform segmentation of polycrystals that is more efficient than
				previous techniques.
