                    Summarizing
                    an issue as complex as decarbonization and the potential avenues to solve it in
                    5 minutes is challenging but worthwhile! We should always keep the big picture
                    in mind before diving into the details. This is the first article of a series
                    intended to provide a compass to navigate through the landscape of our climate
                    crisis, understand it, and move forward towards a sustainable society.

                The problem of global warming originates
                from that, in the current situation, human standards of living, the GDP, energy
                consumption, fossil fuels extraction, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and the average
                temperature of the Earth relative to pre-industrial levels form a chain of correlated
                variables. In fact, these variables also <i>cause</i>
                each other: temperature rises <i>because</i> we emit CO<sub>2</sub> <i>because</i>
                we burn fossil fuels <i>because</i> we use energy <i>because</i> we need energy
                to produce things <i>because</i> we have needs and desires to satisfy.

                Therefore, if we set as an objective
                to maintain high standards of living across the world and at the same time
                limit global warming, then we must take decisions in order to break that chain.
                There are several ways to achieve that:

            <p>
                The challenge is to figure
                out which of these approaches are worth pursuing and to what extent, in a given
                context. This involves evaluating and managing the costs, benefits,
                uncertainties, and risks associated with each option – an aspect heavily influenced
                by existing technologies and market incentives. Let’s have a quick look at each
                approach.

                1 | Reducing energy intensity
            </h2>

            <p>
                Energy
                intensity represents the amount of energy required to generate a unit of GDP. Reducing
                it means reducing the energy cost associated with a product or service.
                This can be achieved by minimizing the energy wasted in operations and
                processes. We can get smarter about the
                management of existing systems, supply, and production chains, and by making
                products more energy efficient. Steel production, for example, accounts for about
                8 percent of the world’s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions [1]. There is a minimum
                energy required to reduce iron ore for making steel which is 7 MJ/kg [2]
                (the free energy of formation) while current processes produce iron at around 25
                MJ/kg [3] (the embodied energy). This leaves a potentially significant room for
                improvement. Energy intensity also decreases when people, companies,
                governments, and organizations opt for using more sustainable products: a city
                can electrify its fleet of buses, for example. Below are examples of
                optimizations with high leverage:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    More efficient cement, steel, aluminium, and fertilizer production.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Retrofitting buildings for increased energy efficiency.
                </li>

                    More fuel-efficient container ships, cars, trucks, and planes.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Smart management of district heating and public lights.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Providing an efficient public transport network and bike lanes.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Optimizing supply and production chains.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Efficient cooling of data centers.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The
                implementation of these solutions is often limited by investment cost and the
                resistance of systems in place to change. To incentivize change, innovation can
                play a role by providing a wider range of better and cheaper solutions, while
                governments can support initial investments. Finally, energy intensity
                is always tight to the Jevons paradox: as a products become more energy-efficient,
                their cost can be reduced, leading to more consumption, and offsetting the energy
                gain. For example, making airplanes more fuel-efficient might translate
                into a reduced ticket price for the consumer, which in turn leads to more people
                flying…

                2 | Reducing carbon intensity
            </h2>

            <p>
                Carbon intensity represents the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted to produce
                a unit of energy. Reducing carbon intensity involves shifting our energy mix from fossil
                fuels to clean energy sources.

            <p>
                Clean alternatives
                to fossil fuels include hydropower, solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, and
                nuclear power. The challenge is to make these energy sources cheaper
                than fossil fuels, on the one hand, and to manage the logistics of implementing a global energy
                transition on the other hand. This objective involves developing the clean energy market and choosing
                the right energy source to employ in a given context. We should consider
                each energy source based on whether it is clean (carbon-free), renewable,
                energy dense, safe, cheap (both in terms of investment and operation costs),
                and available.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Hydro</b>: Dams are great, but we cannot build many more of
                them. On the upside, they can serve as energy storage tanks by working in
                reverse (pumping water downstream into the reservoir). They can create issues
                around the control of fresh water (see the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Ethiopian_Renaissance_Dam" target="_blank">Ethiopia</a>).
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Wind</b>: Wind turbines are getting cheaper and larger – thus more
                efficient. They can be built offshore where wind conditions are more predictable.
                To compensate intermittency, which can be daily and seasonal, wind turbines are
                best combined with energy storage systems or peaking power plants.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Nuclear</b>: Nuclear plants can yield massive amounts of energy
                24 hours a day. They require relatively little space and raw materials. As far as
                safety and handling radioactive waste goes, many new reactors
                designs have been proposed, that could be safer and produce less waste – for example
                those based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactor" target="_blank">liquid fuel and Thorium</a>. Other limitations
                of nuclear power include the time and investment costs involved to build new
                plants, and public opposition.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Biomass</b>: Biomass can be a carbon-neutral source when
                it does not involve net deforestation. There are several “generations” of
                biofuels: those issued from agricultural products such as sugarcane or corn involve
                direct competition with the food sector and significant land usage. This is less
                the case for biofuels produced from woody biomass and
                residues. Finally, there are <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2014.00090/full" target="_blank">biofuels produced from algae</a> which could
                become viable in the near future. Due to their high volumetric
                energy density, biofuels could, in the long run, substitute fossil fuels in airplanes
                and ships.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Solar</b>: Solar energy is great, but it requires space and
                storage to compensate for daily and seasonal intermittency and to
                transport the energy to where it is needed. There is still a lot of exploitable
                space for solar PV on roofs in urbanized areas. Many tropical countries, countries in the Middle East, and
                Australia receive incredible amounts of sunlight; it really makes sense to
                build solar power plants there!
            </p>

            <p>
                It is clear that a successful
                energy transition will involve composing with the benefits and downsides of
                each technology. The scale of a global transition is considerable: today, about
                80% of our energy comes from the combustion of fossil fuels. Reducing this
                fraction to zero will take many years, even with consistently high investments
                in the energy transition, especially in a context where much of the world has
                yet to fully develop economically and socially. Finally, it seems that we will need
                to electrify as much of the transport sector as possible and many industrial
                processes without emitting extra CO<sub>2</sub>. The parts of industry that
                cannot be electrified (for example airplanes and container ships)
                will have to run on hydrogen, biofuels, synthetic fuels, metal fuels or
                electrofuels produced using electricity. Developing effective
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_energy_storage" target="_blank">grid energy storage </a>solutions will be essential to support the
                exploitation of solar and wind technologies at large scale. It seems that electrical batteries
                are not going to be enough there, and the transition to a hydrogen economy is also questionable.
                This leaves a lot of room for innovation regarding
                which “storage mix” to use in combination with the future clean energy grid.
            </p>

                3 | Carbon capture and storage
            </h2>

            <p>
                The idea of CCS is
                to adapt existing fossil fuel power plants, such as gas power plants, to enable
                the capture of CO<sub>2</sub> before it gets released into the atmosphere and to pump it back
                underground. This technology is expensive,
                while it reduces the capacity of a power plant significantly. Therefore, it
                must be “enforced actively” as part of a decarbonization effort, and the cost typically
                supported by the government. This could make sense in certain contexts, as the
                technology can be adapted to existing plants and there are some benefits to
                keeping gas power plants in the energy mix (for example as peak power plants).

            <h2>
                4 | Carbon removal
            </h2>

            <p>
                Even if we eventually transit to
                a fully clean energy system, this transition will take many years to complete. Moreover,
                there are factors other than fossil fuels burning that contribute to GHG
                emissions, such as the emissions coming from deforestation and cows producing methane.
                By deforesting areas of land, the carbon stored in pre-existing biomass is
                released. Moreover, the amount of methane in the atmosphere is approximately in
                equilibrium with the livestock raised on Earth, which is rapidly increasing
                following the demand for meat-based products. The main avenues to remove excess
                CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere are
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_air_capture" target="_blank">direct air capture</a> (DAC) and reforestation.
                The problem with DAC is that it requires energy – which must be produced
                from clean energy sources. Moreover, DAC plants have yet to demonstrate large scale
                deployment. Similarly, planting trees is easy but making sure that the trees
                thrive and mature in the long run is difficult. In many cases, it probably makes more sense
                to avoid emitting CO<sub>2</sub> in the first place rather than emitting it and
                paying for its removal, and to avoid deforesting rather than deforesting and paying for reforestation.

            <p>
                Decarbonization is a complex multifaceted
                challenge and addressing it will require a lot of innovation and coordination
                between international organizations, governments, companies, and consumers. We

                In reality, part of the solution
                lies in optimizing existing systems and designing new products, infrastructures,
                and industrial processes towards energy efficiency. Another part is to complete
                a global energy transition by progressively retiring fossil fuels to the
                benefit of clean energy sources. And finally, we can question our definition
                of what constitutes a “high standard of living” and reconsider our lifestyle
                and attitude towards consumption.

                Successful decarbonization is only one aspect of a sustainable society. In future “5-minute
                reads”, I would like to write more in-depth about the circular economy and
                about the roles that artificial intelligence and materials technologies can play in sustainability.
