            <p>
                During my time as a Research Associate
                in the <i>Additive Microstructure Engineering Laboratory</i> at NTU in Singapore,
                my team was interested in using 3D printing of metals to create new types of <i>
                    functionally graded materials.
                </i> This technology is not yet mature; however, it has
                potential to significantly change the way we design technological parts in the
                future. The idea is that, during the 3D priming process, we control parameters
                such as the laser power or scanning speed to influence the microstructure of
                the material (for example, the morphology and orientation of the grains). In
                this way, we are able to build <i>blocks</i> with different properties within a
                single printed part, in a way similar to a
                <i><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214860420311817" target="_blank">LEGO</a></i>
                structure.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the time, I was involved in the
                characterization of our printed functionally graded materials. In our tests, we
                were including two types of microstructures as rectangular blocks. To validate the
                tests, we needed to quickly check that the blocks were in the right place, with
                the right microstructure. For this, we were using a directional reflectance
                technique to provide a sequence of images of the printed surface, from which a
                <a href="/post_article/1.html">segmentation</a> into two classes (microstructures 1
                and 2) had to be retrieved. There were many possible ways to build the
                segmentation pipeline involving solutions that landed more on the soft- or hard-coding
                side. In this case, I opted for an approach that involved decomposing the
                signal using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis" target="_blank">
                    Principal Component Analysis
                </a> (PCA)
                and feeding the PCA projection to a shallow binary neural network classifier. I
                found that this approach offered the best combination of high performance and lightweight
                computation.

            <p>
                The decoding technology worked,
                more or less, but the program had to be used by other members of my team who
                were not familiar with coding. To make it easy for my collaborators to use my program,
                I integrated to it a Graphical User Interface (GUI) coded in Tkinter (Python). To
                compile the app, the program involved bringing together fifteen different elements
                (displays, menus, windows…) that fulfilled different functions. The app was executed
                from <b>app.py</b> at the top of the directory structure. I also included a
                setup.py, README and license file and backed up the project on
                <a href="https://github.com/MalloryWittwer?tab=repositories" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The GUI featured a primary
                display of the microstructure complemented by two side displays that showed the
                reflectance signal at the mouse cursor location and various other information. On
                the right were specialized panels for data processing and analysis. These
                panels were actually modular; I designed several of them which could be
                included for various studies. Here, in the first panel, resolution of the
                dataset could be reduced, and the field of view cropped, to reduce memory
                requirement. The second panel was for binary classification of microstructural features.
                This panel let the user tailor the segmentation pipeline to quickly iterate
                over different approaches, optimize hyperparameters, visualize and save the
                results. It included options to choose which dimensionality reduction technique
                to apply (PCA, NMF, None) and to customize the neural network architecture (number
                of nodes and layers, regularization, activation function…). Selection of a
                training set, training and prediction of microstructural classes were also accessible
                from within the GUI.

                Overall, I enjoyed working on that
                project and <b>learnt a lot</b>. It was the biggest Python project I had to manage
                so far, in terms of the volume of code to manage. I had to think quite hard in
                order to make the project structure manageable and keep the code simple and
                understandable, while still enabling many complex backend interactions between graphical
                elements, data, and machine learning models. Moreover, particularly enjoyed
                thinking about the <i>user experience</i> which I wanted to be comfortable and intuitive.
                The final program was running smoothly and enabled faster research iterations
                on 3D printed functionally graded materials, which is likely to boost research
                outputs in this field.
