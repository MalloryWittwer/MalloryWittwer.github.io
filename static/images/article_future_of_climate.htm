<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;border:none;padding:0in'>Summarizing
an issue as complex as decarbonization and the potential avenues to solve it in
5 minutes is challenging but worthwhile! We should always keep the big picture
in mind before diving into the details. This is the first article of a series
intended to provide a compass to navigate through the landscape of our climate
crisis, understand it, and move forward towards a sustainable society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The problem of global warming originates
from that, in the current situation, human standards of living, the GDP, energy
consumption, fossil fuels extraction, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and the average
temperature of the Earth relative to pre-industrial levels form a chain of correlated
variables that all follow each other overtime. In fact, these variables also <i>cause</i>
each other: temperature rises <i>because</i> we emit CO<sub>2</sub> <i>because</i>
we burn fossil fuels <i>because</i> we use energy <i>because</i> we need energy
to produce things <i>because</i> we have needs and desires to satisfy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Therefore, if we set as an objective
to maintain high standards of living across the world and at the same time
limit global warming, then we must take decisions on how to break that chain (to
decouple the variables. There are several ways to achieve that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>From there, the challenge is to figure
out which of these approaches are worth pursuing and to what extent, in a given
context. This involves evaluating and managing the costs, benefits,
uncertainties, and risks associated with each option – an aspect heavily influenced
by existing technologies and market incentives. Let’s have a quick look at each
approach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>Energy
efficiency represents how much energy is required to generate a unit of GDP. Reducing
it means reducing the energy cost associated with providing a product or service.
This can be achieved by minimizing the energy wasted in operations and
processes and by optimizing the use of energy. We can get smarter about the
management of existing systems, supply, and production chains, and by making
products more energy efficient. Steel production, for example, accounts for about
8 percent of the world’s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions [1]. There is a minimum
energy required to reduce iron ore for making steel which is of about 7 MJ/kg [2]
(the free energy of formation) while current processes produce iron at around 25
MJ/kg [3] (the embodied energy). This leaves a potentially significant room to
improve efficiency. An increase in energy efficiency also happens when people, companies,
governments, and organizations opt for using more sustainable products: a city
can electrify its fleet of buses, for example. Below are examples of
optimizations with high potential leverage:</span></p>

</span></span><b>Hydro</b>: Dams are great, but we cannot build many more of
them. On the upside, they can serve as energy storage tanks by working in
reverse (pumping water downstream into the reservoir). They can create issues
around the control of fresh water (see the case of <span style='color:#00B0F0'>Ethiopia</span>).</p>

</span></span><b>Wind</b>: Wind turbines are getting cheaper and larger – thus more
efficient. They can be built offshore where wind conditions are more predictable.
To compensate intermittency, which can be daily and seasonal, wind turbines are
best combined with energy storage systems or peaking power plants.</p>

</span></span><b>Nuclear</b>: Nuclear plants can yield massive amounts of energy
24 hours a day. They require relatively little space and raw materials. We need
to safely handle radioactive waste and make the power plants safe. Many new reactors
designs have been proposed, that could be safer and produce less waste – for example,
reactors based on <span style='color:#00B0F0'>liquid fuel and Thorium</span>. Limitations

</span></span><b>Biomass</b>: Biomass can be a carbon-neutral source of energy when
it does not involve net deforestation. There are several “generations” of
biofuels: those issued from agricultural products such as sugarcane or corn involve
direct competition with the food sector and significant land usage. This is less
the case of biofuels of second generation produced from woody biomass and
residues. Finally, there are <span style='color:#00B0F0'>biofuels produced from
algae </span>which could become viable in the near future. Due to their high volumetric
energy density, biofuels could, in the long run, substitute fossil fuels in airplanes

</span></span><b>Solar</b>: Solar energy is great, but it requires space and
storage capacity to compensate for daily and seasonal intermittency and to
transport energy. There is still a lot of exploitable space for solar PV on roofs
in urbanized areas. Many tropical countries, countries in the Middle East, and
Australia receive incredible amounts of sunlight; it really makes sense to
build solar power plants there!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>It is clear that a successful
energy transition will involve composing with the benefits and downsides of
each technology. The scale of a global transition is considerable: today, about
80% of our energy comes from the combustion of fossil fuels. Reducing this
fraction to zero will take many years, even with consistently high investments
in the energy transition, and especially in a context where much of the world has
yet to complete its human development cycle. Finally, it seems that we will need
to electrify as much of the transport sector as possible and many industrial
processes without emitting extra CO<sub>2</sub>. The parts of industry that
cannot be electrified (for example transport via airplanes and container ships)
will have to run on hydrogen, biofuels, synthetic fuels, metal fuels or
electrofuels produced using electricity. Developing effective <b><span
style='color:#00B0F0'>grid energy storage </span></b>solutions<b> </b>will be
essential to support the exploitation of solar and wind technologies. It seems that
electrical batteries are not going to be enough there, and the large-scale use of
hydrogen is also questionable. This leaves a lot of room for innovation regarding
which “storage mix” to use in combination with the future clean energy grid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:
107%'>3 Carbon capture and storage</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>The idea of CCS is
to adapt existing fossil fuel power plants such as gas power plants to enable
the capture of CO<sub>2</sub> before it gets released and to pump it back
underground. At the center of the issue is the facts that this technology is expensive,
while it reduces the capacity of a power plant significantly. Therefore, it
must be “enforced actively” as part of a decarbonization effort, and the cost typically
supported by the government. This could make sense in certain contexts, as the
technology can be adapted to existing plants and there are some benefits to
keeping gas power plants in the energy mix (low land usage, reliable power
generation, no harmful waste). However, one should wonder if other strategies
such as introducing a carbon tax or opting for other clean electricity sources might
be more relevant options.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%'>4 Carbon removal</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Even if we eventually transit to
a fully clean energy system, the transition will take many years to complete. Moreover,
there are factors other than fossil fuels burning that contribute to GHG
emissions, such as the emissions coming from deforestation and cows producing methane.
By deforesting areas of land, the carbon stored in pre-existing biomass is
released. Moreover, the amount of methane in the atmosphere is approximately in
equilibrium with the livestock raised on Earth, which is rapidly increasing
following the demand for meat-based products. The main avenues to remove excess
CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere are through <b><span style='color:#00B0F0'>direct
air capture</span></b><span style='color:#00B0F0'> </span>(DAC) and reforestation.
The problem with DAC is that it requires energy – which must be itself produced
from clean energy sources. Moreover, DAC plants have yet to demonstrate large scale
deployment. Similarly, planting trees is easy but making sure that the planted trees
thrive and mature in the long run is hard. The main scepticism towards the
relevance of carbon removal stems from that, in many cases, it makes more sense
to avoid emitting CO<sub>2</sub> in the first place rather than emitting it and
paying for its removal, and to avoid deforesting rather than deforesting in one
place and paying for reforestation in another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><span style='font-size:18.0pt;
line-height:107%'>5 Geoengineering</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Geoengineering refers to the idea
of artificially cooling the planet, for example by <span style='color:#00B0F0'>pumping
sulphites into the atmosphere </span>or <span style='color:#00B0F0'>dissolving massive
amounts of olivine into the ocean</span>. Most experts agree that geoengineering
would only be a last resort solution to prevent the climate system from running
out of control. Geoengineering might be a worthwhile area to study in order to
understand exactly what is feasible, however it probably makes more sense to
direct investments to clean technologies and to support decarbonization strategies.</p>
